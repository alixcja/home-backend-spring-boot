Here is the backend for EXP Home, which is basically a clone of the [quarkus backend here](https://github.com/alixcja/home-backend-quarkus) and has been completely reengineered in Spring Boot 3.

EXP Home was an internal company website for booking various gaming consoles, console accessories, and games. It also includes a dashboard with all the latest news and important information.

In the future, a restaurant list will be added to make choosing lunch options easier. Additionally, there will be a group order feature and a voting system to decide what to eat for lunch.
